              ultra-long reads of ∼100 kb in average, full-length mRNA or cDNA
              reads in high throughput and genomic contigs over 100 Mb in
              length. Existing alignment programs are unable or inefficient to
              process such data at scale, which presses for the development of
              new alignment algorithms. RESULTS: Minimap2 is a general-purpose
              alignment program to map DNA or long mRNA sequences against a
              large reference database. It works with accurate short reads of
              $\geq$100 bp in length, $\geq$1 kb genomic reads at error rate
              ∼15\%, full-length noisy Direct RNA or cDNA reads and assembly
              contigs or closely related full chromosomes of hundreds of
              megabases in length. Minimap2 does split-read alignment, employs
              concave gap cost for long insertions and deletions and introduces
              new heuristics to reduce spurious alignments. It is 3-4 times as
              fast as mainstream short-read mappers at comparable accuracy, and
              is $\geq$30 times faster than long-read genomic or cDNA mappers
              at higher accuracy, surpassing most aligners specialized in one
              type of alignment. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:

  abstract = "Transcription of eukaryotic genomes involves complex alternative
              processing of RNAs. Sequencing of full-length RNAs using long
              reads reveals the true complexity of processing. However, the
              relatively high error rates of long-read sequencing technologies
              can reduce the accuracy of intron identification. Here we apply
              alignment metrics and machine-learning-derived sequence
              information to filter spurious splice junctions from long-read
              alignments and use the remaining junctions to guide realignment
              in a two-pass approach. This method, available in the software

  abstract = "Genome editing can introduce designed mutations into a target
              genomic site. Recent research has revealed that it can also
              induce various unintended events such as structural variations,
              small indels, and substitutions at, and in some cases, away from
              the target site. These rearrangements may result in confounding
              phenotypes in biomedical research samples and cause a concern in
              clinical or agricultural applications. However, current
              genotyping methods do not allow a comprehensive analysis of
              diverse mutations for phasing and mosaic variant detection. Here,
              we developed a genotyping method with an on-target site analysis
              software named Determine Allele mutations and Judge Intended
              genotype by Nanopore sequencer (DAJIN) that can automatically
              identify and classify both intended and unintended diverse
              mutations, including point mutations, deletions, inversions, and
              cis double knock-in at single-nucleotide resolution. Our approach
              with DAJIN can handle approximately 100 samples under different
              editing conditions in a single run. With its high versatility,
              scalability, and convenience, DAJIN-assisted multiplex genotyping
              may become a new standard for validating genome editing outcomes.",
