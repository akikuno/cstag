              ultra-long reads of ∼100 kb in average, full-length mRNA or cDNA
              reads in high throughput and genomic contigs over 100 Mb in
              length. Existing alignment programs are unable or inefficient to
              process such data at scale, which presses for the development of
              new alignment algorithms. RESULTS: Minimap2 is a general-purpose
              alignment program to map DNA or long mRNA sequences against a
              large reference database. It works with accurate short reads of
              $\geq$100 bp in length, $\geq$1 kb genomic reads at error rate
              ∼15\%, full-length noisy Direct RNA or cDNA reads and assembly
              contigs or closely related full chromosomes of hundreds of
              megabases in length. Minimap2 does split-read alignment, employs
              concave gap cost for long insertions and deletions and introduces
              new heuristics to reduce spurious alignments. It is 3-4 times as
              fast as mainstream short-read mappers at comparable accuracy, and
              is $\geq$30 times faster than long-read genomic or cDNA mappers
              at higher accuracy, surpassing most aligners specialized in one
              type of alignment. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:

  title    = "alignparse: A Python package for parsing complex features from
              high-throughput long-read sequencing",
  author   = "Crawford, Katharine H D and Bloom, Jesse D",
  abstract = "Advances in sequencing technology have made it possible to
              generate large numbers of long, high-accuracy sequencing reads.
              For instance, the new PacBio Sequel platform can generate
              hundreds of thousands of high-quality circular consensus
              sequences in a single run (Hebert et al., 2018; Rhoads \& Au,
              2015). Good programs exist for aligning these reads for genome
              assembly (Chaisson \& Tesler, 2012; Li, 2018). However, these
              long reads can also be used for other purposes, such as
              sequencing PCR amplicons that contain various features of
              interest. For instance, PacBio circular consensus sequences have
              been used to identify the mutations in influenza viruses in
              single cells (Russell et al, 2019), or to link barcodes to gene
              mutants in deep mutational scanning (Matreyek et al., 2018). For
              such applications, the alignment of the sequences to the targets
              may be fairly trivial, but it is not trivial to then parse
              specific features of interest (such as mutations, unique
              molecular identifiers, cell barcodes, and flanking sequences)
              from these alignments. Here we describe alignparse, a Python
              package for parsing complex sets of features from long sequences
              that map to known targets. Specifically, it allows the user to
              provide complex target sequences in Genbank Flat File format that
              contain an arbitrary number of user-defined sub-sequence features
              (Sayers et al., 2019). It then aligns the sequencing reads to
              these targets and filters alignments based on whether the
              user-specified features are present with the desired identities
              (which can be set to different thresholds for different
              features). Finally, it parses out the sequences, mutations,
              and/or accuracy (sequence quality) of these features as specified
              by the user. The flexibility of this package therefore fulfills
              the need for a tool to extract and analyze complex sets of
              features in large numbers of long sequencing reads.",

  abstract = "Genome editing can introduce designed mutations into a target
              genomic site. Recent research has revealed that it can also
              induce various unintended events such as structural variations,
              small indels, and substitutions at, and in some cases, away from
              the target site. These rearrangements may result in confounding
              phenotypes in biomedical research samples and cause a concern in
              clinical or agricultural applications. However, current
              genotyping methods do not allow a comprehensive analysis of
              diverse mutations for phasing and mosaic variant detection. Here,
              we developed a genotyping method with an on-target site analysis
              software named Determine Allele mutations and Judge Intended
              genotype by Nanopore sequencer (DAJIN) that can automatically
              identify and classify both intended and unintended diverse
              mutations, including point mutations, deletions, inversions, and
              cis double knock-in at single-nucleotide resolution. Our approach
              with DAJIN can handle approximately 100 samples under different
              editing conditions in a single run. With its high versatility,
              scalability, and convenience, DAJIN-assisted multiplex genotyping
